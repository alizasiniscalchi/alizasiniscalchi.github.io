      <p>I always hate writing about me paragraphs or being asked a fun fact about myself, because it always makes my life seem utterly boring compared to everyone else.
        However, here I am, writing an about me! As of Fall 2021, I am a current sophomore at Wheaton College MA, and I intend to study Biology, with the possible addition of a Visual Arts and/or Psychology minor (total in the works decision).
        I am fairly uncertain about what I would like to do after Wheaton, however, my top job interest as of right now is Genetic Counseling. So how does digital fabrication fit into that you may ask? 
        Well, I don't really think it does, but thats okay, becasue I love art and I love science, and to me, this class is a way to combine two of my main interests in a way I have never been able to do before.
        Now for some of my go to "fun facts" about me, I have 3 dogs, I have visited Japan, I'm a Scorpio, and I love lemons! If you want to know more about me, always feel free to utilize the contact section below!

    <p>Below, sorted by weeks, will be every project completed over the Fall 2021 Semster in the Intro to Digital Fabrication Class at Wheaton College.
      Each week will contain a summary of the project and how it was completed, along with pictures of the process and final project. Hope you enjoy! </p>

  <div class="w3-container" id="Week 1" style="margin-top:75px"> </div>
  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-pink"><b>Week 1: Make a Website.</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid lightblue" class="w3-round">
    <p>The assingment for this week, week 1, was to create a website, using HTML and brackets. This website will serve as our documentation and submission place for all other assignments throughout the semester. </p>
    
    <img src="TemplateILike.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="TemplateCode.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>I began by searching W3 School template for a template I wanted to base my website off of. I picked the Interior Design Template, because I liked the sidebar menu, that is always accessible on desktop sites. After identifying which template I wanted to use, I copied the code and pasted it into Visual Studio Code, where I would begin to edit and customize the website code.</p>
    
    <img src="TwoIndexesBracketsInsatlledIncorrectly.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>Before I even started my project, I was playing around with Visual Studio Code, and how to publish my website. I was not having luck getting the updated version to appear online. After talking to my Professor, we found it strange that I had two index pages open, and nothing was updating. We then realized that I had downloaded brackets incorrectly. After downloading brackets, I was able to update the page.</p>
    <img src="CodingWeeksSideBar.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="WebsiteWithWeeksSideBarBulleted.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="CodeForNoBullets.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="WebsitewithNoBullets.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>Next, I customized the different tabs in the sidebar to include a home button, an about me page, a button for each week of assingments, and a contact me button. However, the code I used to indent the weeks links in the sidebar below assignments, created a list using bullets which I did not like. As seen in the pictures above, I tried a different code where you specify no style for the list and it removes the bullets, which is exactly what I wanted.</p>
    
    <img src="CodingWhereWeeksSideBarLinksLead.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="CodeWeekInfo.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>After I had the sidebar formatted as I pleased, I directed the sidebar links to where they should lead. Meaning, when you press assignments in the sidebar, it should bring you to assignments on the website. </p>
    
    <img src="CodingCustomizeColors.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="WebsiteWithCutsomColorsAndBrokenImage.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>The next step I took, was more of a design choice, rather than adding information to the website. I changed the code which had all colors as red, to make the sidebar and text pink, and the small underlines in a light blue.</p>

    height="200">
    <img src="SuccessfulAboutMeImage.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>I then wrote out my about me paragrapgh and attempted to insert a picture of my self. The pictures above in chronological order, show each failed attempt at adding the picture: </p>
    <p>1. My attempt at using an online compressor to obtain a URL for my picture. </p>
    <p>2. Where I obtained the link on the online compressor. </p>
    <p>3. My code for displaying the image on my website. </p>
    <p>4. How the picture displayed on my website using the link from the compressor, which did not work. </p>
    <p>5. I then attempted to insert the picture by coding each file directory until I reached the one it was in, which was the same folder as my website code, which failed (looked the same as image 4). </p>
    <p>6. I realized I did not have to go through every directory, the image had to be in the folder with the code and then I just use the image name. However, this image did not work either. </p>
    <p>7. I attempted to upload the same image from a different format, and using the steps from number 6. I also added in code to resize the image to the page because as seen in number 8, the image finally uploaded.</p>
    <p>8. The image on the website!</p>

    <img src="WebsiteWeeksToComeFiller.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>I then added information for all of the weeks in the semester, which included which project I will be working on and the day it is due/will be updated on the website. I used this information as a placeholder until the assignments for each week are submitted.</p>
    
    <img src="CodeLinkedHomeToAboutMe.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="CodeLinkedHomeToHome.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>While playing around on the live server to see if I liked my website, I realized one of my side bar links was incorrect. When you pressed "About Me," instead of bringing you to the About Me page, it brought you home, and the home button wasn't linked to go anywhere. The first picture shows the code containing the mistake, and the second picture shows what I changed the code to.</p>
    
    <img src="CodeForHomeLayoutAndPic.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="WebsiteForHomeLayoutAndPic.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>The main setup of my page was done, but the page looked a little boring. So, I decided to upload the innovation spaces graphic and center the website header to add a little style.</p>
    
    <img src="FillingInWeekOne.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>The last step before publishing my website, was to add in all of the pictures and information for how I created my website. So basically, this. The picture shows all of the images added to the same folder to the left side, and the basic layout I used to insert the text description and image with sizing to my website.</p>
    
    <img src="PublishingCommit.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="PublishingPush.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>Finally, I commited all of my changes, and pushed my website! Week 1 has been published!</p>
