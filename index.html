      <p>I always hate writing "about me" paragraphs or being asked a fun fact about myself, because it always makes my life seem utterly boring compared to everyone else.
        However, here I am, writing an about me! As of Fall 2021, I am a current sophomore at Wheaton College MA, and I intend to study Biology, with the possible addition of a Visual Arts and/or Psychology minor (total in the works decision).
        I am fairly uncertain about what I would like to do after Wheaton, however, my top job interest as of right now is Genetic Counseling. So how does digital fabrication fit into that you may ask? 
        Well, I don't really think it does, but thats okay, becasue I love art and I love science, and to me, this class is a way to combine two of my main interests in a way I have never been able to do before.
        Now for some of my go to "fun facts" about me, I have 3 dogs, I have visited Japan, I'm a Scorpio, and I love lemons! If you want to know more about me, always feel free to utilize the contact section below!

  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-pink"><b>Week 1: Make a Website.</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid lightblue" class="w3-round">
    <p>The assingment for this week, week 1, was to create a website, using HTML and brackets. This website will serve as our documentation and submission place for all other assignments throughout the semester. </p>
    
    <img src="TemplateILike.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="TemplateCode.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>I began by searching W3 School template for a template I wanted to base my website off of. I picked the Interior Design Template, because I liked the sidebar menu, that is always accessible on desktop sites. After identifying which template I wanted to use, I copied the code and pasted it into Visual Studio Code, where I would begin to edit and customize the website code.</p>
    
    <img src="TwoIndexesBracketsInsatlledIncorrectly.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>Before I even started my project, I was playing around with Visual Studio Code, and how to publish my website. I was not having luck getting the updated version to appear online. After talking to my Professor, we found it strange that I had two index pages open, and nothing was updating. We then realized that I had downloaded brackets incorrectly. After downloading brackets, I was able to update the page.</p>
    <img src="CodingWeeksSideBar.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="WebsiteWithWeeksSideBarBulleted.png"

    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="WebsitewithNoBullets.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>Next, I customized the different tabs in the sidebar to include a home button, an about me page, a button for each week of assingments, and a contact me button. However, the code I used to indent the weeks links in the sidebar below assignments, created a list using bullets which I did not like. As seen in the pictures above, I tried a different code where you specify no style for the list and it removes the bullets, which is exactly what I wanted.</p>
    
    <img src="CodingWhereWeeksSideBarLinksLead.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="CodeWeekInfo.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>After I had the sidebar formatted as I pleased, I directed the sidebar links to where they should lead. Meaning, when you press assignments in the sidebar, it should bring you to assignments on the website. </p>
    
    <img src="CodingCustomizeColors.png"

    height="200">
    <img src="WebsiteWithCutsomColorsAndBrokenImage.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>The next step I took, was more of a design choice, rather than adding information to the website. I changed the code which had all colors as red, to make the sidebar and text pink, and the small underlines in a light blue.</p>

    <p>I then wrote out my about me paragrapgh and attempted to insert a picture of my self. The pictures above in chronological order, show each failed attempt at adding the picture: </p>
    <p>1. My attempt at using an online compressor to obtain a URL for my picture. </p>
    <p>2. Where I obtained the link on the online compressor. </p>
    <p>3. My code for displaying the image on my website. </p>
    <p>4. How the picture displayed on my website using the link from the compressor, which did not work. </p>
    <p>5. I then attempted to insert the picture by coding each file directory until I reached the one it was in, which was the same folder as my website code, which failed (looked the same as image 4). </p>
    <p>6. I realized I did not have to go through every directory, the image had to be in the folder with the code and then I just use the image name. However, this image did not work either. </p>
    <p>7. I attempted to upload the same image from a different format, and using the steps from number 6. I also added in code to resize the image to the page because as seen in number 8, the image finally uploaded.</p>
    <p>8. The image on the website!</p>

    <img src="WebsiteWeeksToComeFiller.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>I then added information for all of the weeks in the semester, which included which project I will be working on and the day it is due/will be updated on the website. I used this information as a placeholder until the assignments for each week are submitted.</p>

    <img src="CodeLinkedHomeToHome.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>While playing around on the live server to see if I liked my website, I realized one of my side bar links was incorrect. When you pressed "About Me," instead of bringing you to the About Me page, it brought you home, and the home button wasn't linked to go anywhere. The first picture shows the code containing the mistake, and the second picture shows what I changed the code to.</p>

    <img src="WebsiteForHomeLayoutAndPic.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>The main setup of my page was done, but the page looked a little boring. So, I decided to upload the innovation spaces graphic and center the website header to add a little style.</p>
    
    <img src="FillingInWeekOne.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>The last step before publishing my website, was to add in all of the pictures and information for how I created my website. So basically, this. The picture shows all of the images added to the same folder to the left side, and the basic layout I used to insert the text description and image with sizing to my website.</p>

    <p>Finally, I commited all of my changes, and pushed my website! Week 1 has been published!</p>

  <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-pink"><b>Week 2: Shaper.</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid lightblue" class="w3-round">
    <p>For this weeks project, we created a desk organizer using a CNC Router, the Shaper.</p>

    <img src="demoAI.png" 
    width="200” 
    height="200">
    <img src="machineSafety.png" 
    width="150” 
    height="200">
    <p>To start off my porject, I first had to sign up to be traianed on the Shaper, as I have never used it before. Upon arriving for my appointment, Madison, my Professor and Trainer, walked me through the steps of creating a design in Adobe to be cut on the Shaper. We then went over the, extremely important, machine safety steps.</p>
    <img src="stickingProjectToBoard.png" 
    width="300” 
    height="200">
    <p>Before you can start working on the machine, you have to save your Adobe Illustrator file to the shaper thumb drive, which can be plugged directly into the shaper machine. In order to safely cut on your wood stock, you must secure it to the board by applying a strong double sided tape, and screwing the wood into the workspace, so that the top of your wood is flat (no screw heads sticking out).</p>
    <img src="mappingWorkspace.png" 
    width="300” 
    height="200">
    <p>Prior to cutting your design, you have to map your workspace. To do this, you move the shaper around your workspace so that you have scanned your whole stock, while also always having the special mapping tape in view, so that each square of the mapping tape turns blue on the shaper screen, meaning it is fully mapped.</p>
    <img src="useTheVacumm.png" 
    width="300” 
    height="200">
    <img src="cuttingProcess.png" 
    width="450” 
    height="200">
    <p>We learned that it is always important to plug the vacuum into the machine, so that it collects the wood being cut from your board, as to avoid it flying off your project, or built up debris getting in the way of your work. It is also important to stop periodically in between the different cuts in your project to vacuum the board to ensure a clean and smooth surface. </p>
    <img src="safetyProtection.png" 
    width="300” 
    height="200">
    <p>As previously mentioned, machine safety is very important. In the above picture, I would like to highlight the use of earplugs and safety goggles when the spindle is set to on and you are actively cutting.</p>
    <img src="shaperRefresh.png" 
    width="300” 
    height="200">
    <p>To cap off my training, I reviewed the posted, Shaper Review video, before going into the lab to work on my final project, to refresh my memory on how the machine works.</p>
    
    <p>There are a few really cool features, which are big parts of how the Shaper works, that I would like to highlight.</p>
    <img src="mappingWorkspace2.png" 
    width="300” 
    height="200">
    <p>The first cool feature is mapping your workspace, which I have explained the process of above. This is very useful because it stores your workspace on the Shaper, meaning you could alwasy duplicate your project with ease, or, if necessary, finish your project another day.</p>
    <img src="shaperScreen.png" 
    width="300” 
    height="200">
    <p>The screen on the Shaper is vital to properly using the machine. The screen alows you to see and, map your workspace, locate the various places to cut on your workspace, calibrate the end mill using "z-touch," change the depth at which the end mill cuts, change the type of cut, and many other things we didn't even begin to touch upon.</p>
    <img src="shaperTools.png" 
    width="100” 
    height="200">
    <p>The two bits we used for our project were, the V-Bit and the 1/4" downcut flat end mill. The V-Bit was used for cutting out our text and the flat end mill was used for our pocket cutting and cutting out our project. There is also a long tool change accessory, which is used to loosen the spindle, so you can remove it and change the end mill. After removing the spindle, you have to use the wrench to loosen and remove the end mill, and then to tighten the new end mill.</p>
    <img src="cuttingOnShaper.png" 
    width="300” 
    height="200">
    <p>When cutting on the Shaper machine, remember to always have both hands on the handles and not to make any sudden movements that may throw off the cutting process. The green button on the right handle is used for cutting and the yellow/orange button on the left handle is for retracting the spindle.</p>
    <img src="finishedCuttingStillOnBoard.png" 
    width="300” 
    height="200">
    <p>When cutting out the final perimeter, it is important to only cut between 0.25 and 0.4 inches at a time, it may take a few laps around the perimeter. It is also very important to remember to leave two tabs on the last go around. If you dont leave tabs, your final product is subject to come flying off the workspace. After the project is complete, and the Shaper has been turned off and moved form the workspcae, you use a hammer and chisel to break the tabs, which you can then sand off.</p>
    
    <img src="howToCreatNewSketchFusion.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="startingSketchFusion.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>To make the design for my desk organizer, I had to first start by designing a sketch and render in Fusion 360. We start with a basic sketch of all the cutouts and dimensions.</p>
    <img src="filetingEdgesAndAddignDimensionToMainBody.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="addingDimensionsFusion.png"

    height="200">
    <img src="filetingEdgesFusion.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>To sketch my design, I utilized the rectangle and circle shape tools. I also used the filet tool on every rectangle corner, to round the edge, which was a stylistic choice. When creating my shapes, I typed in the dimensions as the boxes automatically appeared on the screen. These dimensions correlated to items I owned, and measured, which I planned to store in the organizer.</p>
    <img src="finishedSketchFusion.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="extrudingTheMainBodyFusion.png"

    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="realisticRenderFusion.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>After I finished adding all of my cutout shapes and arranging them as I desired, I pressed finish sketch. I was then able to enter into render mode, which provides a better mock up of what the final project will look like. By pressing "e", and a specific component, I was able to extrude each component to its proper height. I was then able to add a material, wood, which shows a professional and finished render of my project design.</p>
    <img src="renderFusion.png"

    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="savingAsDXFFusion.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>To export my project, I first had to hide Body 2 from the browse view tab to the left, to get the basic sketch render. I then tried to save my design and export it as a DXF, but I kept recieving an error that I could not export it as a DXF without the paid version of Fusion 360. After talking to another student in the class, I learned that I had to return to sketch mode, and right click the sketch in the left browse bar and select "Save As DXF".</p>
    <img src="fileConversion.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="fileConversionComplete.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>The new version of Adboe Illustrator no longer excepts DXF files, so I used an online file converter, Convertio, to convert from a DXF file to an AI (Adobe Illustrator) file.</p>
    <img src="importingToAIInitial.png"

    <img src="basicDesignAI.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>After downloading the correct file type, I imported my sketch into Illustrator. I then resized it to fit the workspace and my stock of wood, 12.5"x8.5".</p>
    <img src="dragonflyAI.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>To finalize my design, I had to add some text. I decided to add my initials to the bottom right corner, where I had left a blank space. Using the oval shape tool in Illustrator, I created a dragonfly shape to be cut in the same manner as my text. Dragnoflies have a very special meaning in my family, and I wanted to add a touch more personalization to my project.</p>
    <img src="colorCodingCutsAI.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <img src="finishedDesignAI.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>The Shaper, has this special technology that allows you to color code your components in illustrator to represent different types of cuts. So when I plugged my design into the machine, it automatically knew which type of cut I was using for each component. So, I color coded my components, and then completed my design, and saved it to the shaper thumb drive.</p>

    <p>To begin my project, I first had to be trained on the Prusa MK3 FDM Printer. During my trianing, I was walked through the steps of designing and printing a small keychain. The first step was to design the keychain in Fusion360, as we learned how to use for our last project. Then we had to upload the design to Prusa Slicer, which I will explain later, and export that code to the SD card used for the printer.</p>

    <p>To begin printing, make sure that the magnetic tray is in place, and add a layer of glue stick to the board if you are using a bigger project that may need help sticking. Before starting the project, the screen will display the temperature, which has to get to a certain point before begining. Using the dial, select unload filament to begin switching filament colors, and follow the on screen instructions. Similarly, twist the dial to load filament and follow the instructions until the nozzle dispenses your color. Then I was able to select my file and start printing my demo!</p>

    <p>The next step was to start desigining my cup in Fusion360. The techniques are very similar to the techniques we learned and used while making the desk organizer, so I won't go into too much detail, but I will explain my process. I began by creating the sketch with the base of my cup, which matched the diameter of the circle in my desk organizer plus 0.25" to account for the quarter inch end mill used on the Shaper. Then I extruded the base to the desired height.</p>

    <img src="allPlanesWithCircles.png" 
    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>To create a more bulbus shape, rather than a straight cylinder, I had to create 2 new planes. On those planes I added circles of my desired diameter, to shape the cup.</p>

    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>The next step is to loft your project, which follows the same concept as extruding it. But, lofting brings the shapes up to each plane, to create the bulbus cup shape. After lofting the cup, I realized that I was not happy with the size of the circle on the second plane, so I went in and edited that sketch. I also measured the pens I planed on putting in the cup, and I realized I wanted the cup to be taller, so I raised the height of the top plane.</p>

    <p>I then had to decide how I wanted to design the exterior of my cup. I started scrolling through different shapes and sketches in Fusion360, until I stumbled upon the Torus tool. I was drawn to this design because it lays horizontally on the cup, rather than vertically, which is the more common design I have seen. Using the torus tool, I added a ring to my cup and adjusted the diameter and thicknes to fit along my cup. I repeated this process all the way up the cup.</p>

    width="500” 
    height="200">
    <p>To finish my cup design, I added a shell, which basically hollows out my shape to make it a useable cup. Then I filetd the brim of the cup to give it a softer appearance that matched the rings.</p>

    <p>After exporting my Fusion360 design as an STL file, in my finder screen, I right clicked on the file and pressed open with PrusaSlicer. My computer then opened PrusaSlicer, with my project on a mock up of the magnetic printer map. In the right side bar, I changed the print settings to 0.20mm SPEED, which is an appropriate setting to achieve quality and some level of time efficiency. I also confirmed that the filament type selected was Prusament PLA, which matched the filament I was using, and the machine it was set to was the MK3. I set infill to 10%, which determines how hollow the project will print, mine didn't have to be very dense because it is just a pen holder.</p>

    <p>Once all of my settings were to my liking, I exported the gcode and saved it to the SD card used for the FDM printers. Using the same steps to print as I did for the demo keychain I began printing my project.</p>

    <p>It is required that we stay in the room for the first 30 minutes of the print, as thats typically when something will go wrong if it is going to. I stayed for the first 3 hours becuase the fan on my printer was broken so the nozzle kept spitting out random chuncks of filament, some blue filament can still be seen in the cup. After 3 hours, I felt comfortable leaving, and per lab rules, I left a sticky note in front of the machine with my name and number in case of a problem. I returned to the the lab in 2.5 hours, 30 minutes before my project should have been done. However, when I got there, I realized the printer was still running, but there was no filament, meaning my project had continued printing for at least over an hour with nothing actually printing. So, as of 9/20/21, I only have half of my cup design printed, which still printed a useable cup, however, I will upload my finished cup once I can reprint my project.</p>

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid lightblue" class="w3-round">
    <p>For this weeks project I created a ring using the SLA Printer. Unfortunately, we were not permitted to use the SLA Printers, due to the fact that we would have such little training time and the resin used in the printer is dangerous upon contact. It was thought that we would need more time than possible to be properly trained. So, I was able to do my own research into how the printer works, and I designed a braided ring, by following a provided video, and sent my design to my TA to have it printed. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>SLA (Stereolithography) Printing is a form of 3D Printing that uses resin to create the 3D object. The printer creates the 3D object layer by layer, by using a laser to harden the liquid resin.</p>
    <p> </p>

    height="200">
    <img src="ringsDone.jpg" 
    width="300” 
    height="200">
    <p>Through researching the SLA printers, I learned the basic procedure for using and handling the printer. It is very important to wear gloves throughout the entire process, because if resin comes in contact with the skin it can cause a serious rash. If you have to change the resin cartridge, make sure you put in a clean resin basin that is programmed to the color of the resin cartridge. Clean the design plate with isopropyl to assure it is completely clean from old resin. After reassembling the printer and after your design is prepared with supports, you can then send it to the printer to begin printing. After the printer is complete, you can remove the 3D object using a spatula and add it to the cleaning machine and set it to the specific settings of your resin. This step will remove any excess resin from your project and make it safe to touch. After it has finished cleaning, add the object to the curing machine and set it to the settings for your resin. This final step is what allows the resin to cure, or fully harden. Once it is done, you can take it out and cut off the supports, which is the step in which I was able to takeover at.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>To design my actual ring, I followed the Bradided Ring tutorial, which was posted on our classes website, and is also linked below. A pro to this video would be that the actual methods used were not very difficult. A major con to this video is that the creator worked so quickly and his measurements seemed so random that it was hard to replicate. I will talk about the problem this caused me a little further down.</p>

    height="200">
    <img src="afterPipe.png" 
    width="400” 
    height="200">
    <p>The first new tool I learned while creating my braided ring was the Pipe tool. To use the pipe tool, you first create a linear design and then select the design and select pipe, which creates a cylindrical shape around whatever linear design was selected.</p>

    height="200">
    <img src="flangedArc.png" 
    width="400” 
    height="200">
    <p>The flange tool was the next new tool I learned. This tool was under the sheet metal tab. After researching the tool it seems to be used to create a face and bend attached to an existing face. However, when we used it, it almost seemed similar to using the extruding tool. </p>

    height="200">
    <img src="arcUnfolded.png" 
    width="400” 
    height="200">
    <p>The next new tool was so simple, yet a tool I never would have expected to find. After using the flange tool on the arc, I was able to use the un-fold tool to completely starighten the arc.</p>

    height="200">
    <img src="scaledPipe.png" 
    width="400” 
    height="200">
    <p>To change the size of the pipe curvature so that 4 copies would fit on the unfolded arc, half of the circle(ring), I learned how to use the scale tool. I put the measurement of the unfolded arc, the number 4 which represents how many of the pipe I wanted to fit, and the measurement of the pipe. After pressing okay, my pipe design was successfully resized.</p>

    <img src="reFoldedPipeAndArc.png" 
    width="400” 
    height="200">
    <p>The next tool I learned was more of a technique and a repeat of one of the other new tools. For this part of the design, I created a square on the face of the arc and extruded it to create a box. Then I extruded it downwards to join it to the pipe curvature. After the two were connected, I was able to refold the arc, and with it the pipe curvature. I was able to refold the arc with the pipe by creating a bridge between the two of them using the block.</p>

    <img src="circularPatternAfterTriangleWrong.png" 
    width="400” 
    height="200">
    <p>The one part of the design process that I really struggled with was when, in the video, he added a triangle and extruded it down to cut the pipe. As I mentioned earlier, I tried my best to follwo his measurements, but he speed through it so quickly, I thought I had done the triangle right, however, my triangle was smaller than his. So, when I attempted to create a circular pattern and copy thr pipe, the pipes didnt all meet, creating a solid ring, becuase each segment was too short. </p>

    <p>After going over my design with my TA and putting the YouTube video in 0.5x speed, we were able to recreate the exact measurements of the triangle and succesfully create the circular pattern, whcih we repeated twice to create the final braided ring design.</p>

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid lightblue" class="w3-round">
    <p>For this weeks project I created a t-shirt design using Adobe Illustrator and Sure Cuts A Lot and used the vinyl cutter and heat press to create my final t-shirt! </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>In my opinion, vinyl cutting is a form of digital fabrication. To summarize the definition of digital fabrication, it refers to using manufacturing equipmet by way of digital data. So, for vinyl cutting, we created our design using Adobe Illustrator and Sure Cuts A Lot on our computers. By using these software platforms, we created digital data of our design, that we then sent to the vinyl cutting machine to tell it how to opperate. The vinyl cutter was able to cutt our design because of our digital file, which makes it digital fabrication.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>A raster image is a image or photograph that contains many tiny pixels which come together to form the whole image. A vector image, on the other hand, uses a mathematical formula to form lines inbetween points to digitally render an image. While working in Adobe Illustrator, I selected an image and then selected "Image Trace" to convert the image from a rastor image to a vector image. This gave my image perceftly smooth, non-pixalated edges, which will be a easier and better looking when sent to the vinyl cutter.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <img src="mySavedGraphics.png" 
    width="400” 
    height="200">
    <p>I chose the 4 dog silhouettes, to represent my dogs. I had a chocolate lab, who recently passed away, represented by the first silhouette of the dog laying down, I have a yellow lab, represented by the second silhouette of the dog sitting, I have a resuce hound/lab/mut mix, represented by the silhouette of the third dog sitting, and I have a resuce pitbull/boxer mix represented by the fourth dog sitting. After scrolling through many dog silhouettes, I somehow found 4 that truly resembled my dogs! I knew that I wanted to do my puppies, because I jump at the chance to do anything related to dogs, so the most difficult part was coming up with a quote. I stumbled upon the quote, "Dogs are like chips... you can't have just one" and thought it was so cute and fititing since I have many pups. The quote and graphic fell into place quite easily since I knew my inspiration, so next came arranging it all on the shirt. </p>
    <img src="myDocumentSetUp.png" 
    width="400” 
    height="200">
    <p>To begin my design, I started a new project in Illustrator and made the dimensions of my workspace to be an estimate of the dimensions of the t-shirt I plan to create. This way I can have a guide for sizing as I create my design.</p>
    <img src="insertText.png" 
    width="400” 
    height="200">
    <img src="formatText.png" 
    width="400” 
    height="200">
    <p>I first added my quote, by simply using the text tool. I then played around with some different fonts and sizing until I was happy with the text format.</p>

    <img src="pawsInPlace.png" 
    width="400” 
    height="200">
    <p>Eventhough I already had my graphics picked out, I decided I wanted to put those on the back with the text on the front. However, I felt like the front needed something else, so I added a graphic of four foot prints to represent the four dogs. After inserting the image, I selected "Image Trace" to turn it into a vector image. Then I selected "Expand" to gain more options, where I then selected "Isolate Image," which allowed me to delete the parts of the image I did not want. To finalize the front design, I just moved the paw prints into place.</p>

    <img src="frontDesignMeasurements.png"

    height="200">
    <p>To create the back design, I cleared my workspace, becuase I already had a copy of the front design saved, and it was easy to re-use the measurements. Then I repeated the steps I used to insert the paw print graphic on the front, for all four of my dog graphics. Again, those steps are, paste image onto workspace, select "Image Trace," select "Expand," select "Isolate Image," remove any unwanted parts of the graphic, and then resize the graphic.</p>

    <p>Once I got into the lab, I turned the vinyl cutter on and to the appropriate setting for cutting apparel vinyl. Then I had to add my front graphic in to the software, Sure Cuts A Lot, on the designated computer. I adjusted the sizing to make sure it fit the t-shirt I had taken from the cabinet. The most important step is to remember to flip the graphic horizontally since you flip the vinyl over to transfer it. I then pressed "Cut with Cutter" and sent my design to the vinyl cutter. I repeated these steps with the back design.</p>

    <p>After all of my design had been cut onto the vinyl, I had to weed out my design. The weeding process refers to removing all of the excess/background vinyl, that is not part of my design. This includes the spaces in between letters and anything else you wouldn't want on your final shirt.</p>

    <p>Now that my design was all ready to be transferred to my shirt, I had to turn the heating press on and wait until the temperature reached high 300s, about 370 degrees farenheit. I pre-pressed my shirt to remove the wrinkles, and then began placing my front design. After pressing my front design for 10 seconds, I flipped the shirt over and placed and pressed my back design for 10 seconds.</p>

    <p>For this weeks project, I created a heart shaped box, with parametric kerfing, on the laser cutter. </p>

    <p>The design process for this week was actually quite simple. We used a website, provided by our teacher, to generate the design for our box. Upon opening the website, I selected the type of box I wanted to create, the shape, and then it opened a form where I could change the dimensions and such.</p>

    <p>To gain a better idea of the size I was working with, I converted 19in. (the width of our wood) into mm. I then typed this value, approximately 482mm, into the reference value for the box design to see if the layout would fit. After generating the box, I saw that the design was over the 482mm reference, so I proportionally decreased the width and height of the box design until it fit within the reference width. </p>

    <p>After achieving the proper measurements, I saved my design as a .svg file.</p>

    <p>The last step in my design process was to import my box design into Adobe Illustrator and add text. Upon adding the file to Illustrator, I deleted the reference box from the design, added text, and added a dragonfly for an additional design. Before exporting my file, I had to select the text and press "Create Outlines" which turns the text into a shape which can be cut on the laser cutter. I then saved my finished design file as a .svg.</p>

    <p>When I arrived at the lab to begin cutting my project, I opened the website, app.glowforge.com, and uploaded my .svg file. This program connects right to the printer, which I then turned on.</p>

    <p>I picked out a piece of birch plywood from the "Free to Use" drawer and placed it into the laser cutter. This drawer contains pre-approved material, since the laser cutter is a CO2 cutter and can only safely cut organic material. I then turned on the air filter, which reduces smoke, smell, and risk of fire. </p>

    <p>On the glowforge site, I then set my focus around the engraving. I then pressed print on the glowforge site, which then displayed my time estimate, and I pressed the blue blinking start button on the laser cutter.</p>

    width="400” 
    height="200">
    <p>The laser cutter then began engraving and cutting. The whole process took a little under 20 minutes, in which I stood in the designated area and watched. The machine began by engraving the intitials and dragonfly, and then moved on to the cutting process.</p>

    <p>After the laser has concluded cutting, the glowforge site states that the machine is cooling down and will then tell you when it is ready. After it finished cooling, I had my completed laser cut design. The last step was to construct the box by using the live hinges to bend around the arcs of the heart and piece the gridlocks together.</p>

    <p>Once the pieces were all put together, I had my finished heart box!</p>
